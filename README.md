# Front-End-for-Star-Stable-AB
Star Stable AB gave me a task to turn a "simple white horse" in a html file to a good looking application to run the functionality from their Back-End code written in Python. This application is a Todo list where you can create/update/remove notes with realtime date and store the data into the Sqlite3 database.
